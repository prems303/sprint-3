Visitors - beginners and expertise alike - can use the blogs and other such things as examples either for themselves or others to further improve their skills by taking any advice they can find. I would like the website to be all- device friendly through which they can navigate to different pages.

I would like to use HTML and CSS with minimum elements so that the site looks tidy and pleasing to the eye.
